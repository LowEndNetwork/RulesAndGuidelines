# Racism, threats, and so on
Racist remarks, threats, supporting terrorist activity, threatening people to die, motivating people to commit harm to themselves, and anything the like will result in an irrevocable permanent ban.

# Posting offers
These rules are in place to both protect the members of this community as well as requiring a certain participation before people can start posting offers.

* Members must have **5 posts** and have been registered for **14 days** to be allowed to post in this forum.  
* Members must be approved by a member of staff before being able to post offers.  
* You must have a website with a proper ordering system. "Email me to get this deal" does not count.
  * For currency other than USD, use the foreign exchange on the day of posting to verify the cost fits the requirement and post the exchange rate of that day.
  * Do not list packages that do not pass the pricing test, even if you have one or more that do.
  * List the final price after any discounts/coupons. Just the discount percentage is not enough.
* **Maximum 1 offer thread per provider per 14 days.** More frequent than that would be regarded as SPAM and the thread(s) will be removed.
* **Using a nulled WHMCS** grants you a lifetime ban on LowEndBox and LowEndTalk.
* Providers need to display valid Public WHOIS information on their domain OR provide proof of company registration (publicly accessible on the website of your country's commerce authority).
* It is not allowed to respond to threads requesting an offer with "PM me" or "e-mail me" without having had a public thread on LowEndTalk.com with your provider details in it (in accordance with our guidelines) _OR_ a public statement of which company you represent.
* No unlimited in offers! This means you can not ever feature unlimited disk space. If you offer unlimited bandwidth **you need to specify the limiting factor** and **whether it's shared with other people or not**! Naturally, having unlimited features (like the number of mailboxes) is allowed.  

* **You need to be manually approved in order to post offers in addition to complying with the above rules!** Please contact an 'Administrator' or a 'Full Moderator' to request access.

* Please be informative in your offers. Please list out basic specifications (amount of memory, storage space, monthly data/bandwidth and port speed), virtualization method (Xen, OpenVZ, KVM, etc), data center location and a test IP would be ideal.
<br />

* **Low End offers only**. Currently a price point must be met
  * VPS must not exceed **USD$7/month** recurring on monthly billing, with no setup fee, or
  * VPS must not exceed **USD$15/year** recurring on annual billing, with no setup fee, if the provider has been in business for less than a year, or
  * VPS must not exceed **USD$48/year** recurring on annual billing, with no setup fee, if the provider has been in business for more than a year, or
 * VPS must not exceed **USD$96/3 years** recurring on at most tri-annual billing, with no setup fee, if the provider **is a registered business and has been one for at least two years**.
  * Dedicated must not exceed **USD$49/month** recurring on monthly billing, with no setup fee.
  * **Only monthly pricing for dedicated servers!**

# Domain Auctions & Sales
* Auction Start/Reserve price can not be set above $7  
* All bids must be public and made in the domain auction topic  
* Members can only list 1 domain auction thread per 30 days  
* All domain auction threads are set to "sink" after 24 hours so replies no longer bump them to the top of the forum  
* Members must have 25 posts and have been registered for 14 days to be allowed to list a domain sale  
* Domain needs to be **at least 6 months old**
* A deal is a deal. A failure to actually sell/transfer the domains after having offered them on action will have consequences for you at LowEndTalk. A failure to respond or finish the transaction in a decent matter (or at all) as the highest bidder may also have consequences for you at LowEndTalk.
* We don't hold any responsibility for potential disputes between two parties. Participating in auctions is at your own risk.
* You may _only_ sell domains for a virtual currency if you put up a fixed exchange rate in the initial post. Changing this exchange rate later _will_ have consequences.

_Other offers, which may not fit into the above categories, may be listed on a case-by-case basis with our permission. The requirements for these offers are: at least registered for 14 days, a minimum of 25 posts and maximum of one offer per 30 days with our permission. Depending on the type of offer, standard VPS pricing and other guidelines may also apply._

# Reviews
Customer posting a review about a provider must be willing to provide proof of being/having been a customer there within two months of posting the review. In addition to that, any support tickets related to the case at hand should be shared in case the customer still has access to those.

A violation of this rule could result in a temporary ban. Bad reviews will be moved to the "off-topic" section where community moderation will render the review useless.

# Signatures  
Signatures may contain only text, with a maximum of two lines, and hyperlinks, with a maximum of three in total. The only HTML you are allowed to use it to make text bold, italic, underlined, to strike something through, or to add a hyperlink. Any other HTML, CSS, images, or other media are not allowed. This includes giving color to text or making it stand out more than normal content.

Having your complete signature underlined, bold, italic, or a combination of those is an example of having a signature 'stand our more than normal content'.

# General rules

We also have some basic rules (which are mainly common decency) which are listed here for your conveniece. This list is **not** exclusive.  

* Do not SPAM (i.e. post multiple threads on the same topic, continuously post completely irrelevant information in threads)!  
* Just to repeat: no racism, threatening people, and so on. These are bannable offences!
* **_Respect!_ We are all human beings, we all make mistakes and we all have different opinions. A failure to be respectfull can result in a temporary ban or, eventually, a permanent one.**
